 * variable hiding interact across an inheritance hierarchy.
 *
 * <p>Concepts reinforced:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code protected} members are inherited but still respect package and subclass boundaries.</li>
 *   <li>{@code this} resolves naming conflicts by pointing at the current instance, whereas
 *       {@code super} targets the parent portion of the object.</li>
 *   <li>Variable hiding stores separate copies of fields with the same name at different hierarchy
 *       levels.</li>
 * </ul>
