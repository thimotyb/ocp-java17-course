/**
 * Gathers the Chapter 7 "Creating Nested Classes" listings. Each nested type demonstrates one of
 * the four flavours described in the book: static nested classes, inner classes, local classes, and
 * anonymous classes.
 *
 * <p>Important observations from the section:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Inner classes capture the enclosing instance and can freely read its members.</li>
 *   <li>Static nested classes behave like top-level classes but can access static members of the
 *       enclosing class.</li>
 *   <li>Local classes (declared within methods) have access to effectively final variables.</li>
 *   <li>Anonymous classes are concise local classes used for single-use behaviours such as passing a
 *       {@link Noise} implementation.</li>
 * </ul>
